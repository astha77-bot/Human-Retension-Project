However, every year, around certain Percentage of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons 

1.The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners.

2.A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talents.

3.More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize themselves to the company.

Therefore,I developed a Model to detect which of the employee will give resignation and also to analse the reason of his resignation results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to Stay.
